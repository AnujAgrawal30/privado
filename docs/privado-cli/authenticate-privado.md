# Authenticate Privado 

Privado CLI requires a license key to run scans. To generate a license, run the following command:
```
privado auth <your_email@example.com>
```
A copy of the license will be emailed to you. 

To authenticate and bootstrap the app using the generated license, run:
```
privado bootstrap </path/to/privado-license.json>
```

and done! You are all set to scan your projects and generate compliance reports.

> Please note that generated licenses are valid for 1 year from the date of issue.    
> For more information about licensing, feel free to get in touch with us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/devprivops/shared_invite/zt-yk5zcxh3-gj8sS9w6SvL5lNYZLMbIpw) or [Email](mailto:support@privado.ai).
