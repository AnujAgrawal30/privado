### Review Data Elements

Privado scans the source code of your application for over 200 data elements and looks at data collection like user forms, Android permissions, etc. to discover data elements your mobile app is collecting or sharing.

Click on the View button to see where we found the data element, in case you find a discovery is wrong, mark it false positive and we will remove the data element from the report.

### Review SDKs

Our scan also discovers all third-party SDKs, libraries that your mobile app uses. For popular SDKs we have a database of default data collected, shared and purposes & we will fill these details automatically. For SDKs, where we do not have the information, please select the values in the next steps.
