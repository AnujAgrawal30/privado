# Privado CLI
Privado CLI scans &amp; monitors your repositories to build privacy, transparency reports &amp; finds privacy issues.

## About Privado
We are building Privado with a fundamental belief that privacy is the defining problem of this decade and developers want to build Privacy first products. However, current solutions take a top-down checklist kind of compliance approach. Our vision is to enable developers to embed privacy in their products. Our first product is a code scanner built up grounds up for privacy which will allow developers to get visibility into privacy issues in their products and will generate transparency reports for the users of these products.  

## Introducing Code Scanning for Privacy
Code is where the business logic of collecting, sharing and processing of personal data lives. We are scanning the source code to discover personal data, data flows, 3rd party integrations automatically. These scans enable developers to build transparency reports with very little effort and also surfaces privacy issues in the code.

### Privacy Reports:
1. Transparency Report like Privacy Pplicy
2. Privacy compliance reports like GDPR Article 30 or RoPA report
3. Apple Privacy Nutrition Label report
4. Google Safety Section report

### Privacy Issues
We are building a OWASP like list of common privacy issues and will open-source them soon. Some examples of privacy issues are:
1. Dark Patterns: A pre-checked consent box
2. Personal data going to logs

This project is still under development, we encourage you to join our slack channel and collaborate with us.
